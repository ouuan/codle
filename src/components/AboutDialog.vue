        Codle is a game developed by
        <external-link
          href="https://github.com/ouuan"
          title="ouuan"
        />.
        In this game, you need to guess the parse tree (concrete syntax tree)
        of a piece of code called "target code".
        It's like
        <external-link
          href="https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html"
          title="Wordle"
        />
        with tree nodes as "letters".

        It's open-sourced at

          <strong>Why not make daily puzzles?</strong>
          <p>
            To give you more time to solve the puzzles :)
            <br>
            Well, I have to admit that's not the main reason.
            Unlike Wordle and many other puzzle games, Codle's puzzles cannot be auto-generated.
            I need to manually select a coding problem that suits Codle well,
            write a solution that is fun to guess and provides enough hints via variable names, etc.
            It takes at least a half and sometimes a few hours
            if puzzle quality is taken into count.
          </p>
        </n-li>
        <n-li>
          <strong>Can I play previous puzzles?</strong>
          <p>
            On the official game site, unfortunately, no you can't :(
            <br>
            However, you can click the calendar icon on the top to see all previous puzzles.
            Codle is
            <external-link
              href="https://github.com/ouuan/codle"
              title="open-source"
            />,
            so you can run Codle locally and play previous puzzles or custom puzzles.

        </n-li>
        <n-li>
          <strong>How many people play Codle?</strong>
          <p>
            Take the week of 8 May - 14 May 2022 as an example,
            there were 111 visitors and 10 game successes.
            So please share (your scores) with others if you like this game :)
          </p>
        </n-li>
        <n-li>
          <strong>What are other players' scores?</strong>
          <p>
            In the first 6 weeks, according to the anonymously collected guess count data,
            the average number of guesses is 47.8 and the median is 34.5.
          </p>
        </n-li>
        <n-li>
          <strong>I succeeded without a correct solution to the problem!</strong>
          <p>
            That's how Codle works :)
            <br>
            Parse tree is the only thing that matters, and your code doesn't even need to compile.
